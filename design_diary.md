Thinking of training a better discriminator, I think I will maybe also incorporate null pictures. I.E. help train the discrimnator to ensure that it also understand that SOMETHINGS are not dogs. 

Using old trust script, I can download some animals e.g. cats, office, random images to prevent discriminator from seeing the world full of dogs.

A more effective disciminiator will undoubtedly improve generator performance as they are trained in pair. So the more exotic shxt discrimnator see, the better generator will have to come up with to fool the discriminator ideally. 

We will see how easy that is to do in practice.

Quite an elegantly and simply crafted DC gan that is barely a few hundred lines lone. I could add so much more to it: inception module for better scale invariant discrimination, more supplementary random data that will ensure higher specificity.
